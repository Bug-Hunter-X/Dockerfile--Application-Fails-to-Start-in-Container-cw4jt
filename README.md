# Dockerfile Bug: Application Fails to Start

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Dockerfiles where the application fails to start within the container.  The provided `Dockerfile` lacks proper error handling and logging, making debugging difficult.  The `Dockerfile_solution` provides a corrected version with improved error handling and logging.

## Bug Description:

The original `Dockerfile` attempts to build and run a Node.js application. However, it omits crucial details such as logging, error handling and robust dependency management, leading to an uninformative failure when there is a problem during build or run time. 

## Solution:

The solution involves several improvements:

* **Detailed logging:** Adding `RUN npm install --verbose` to provide verbose output during installation.
* **Multi-stage build:** for smaller image size. (Optional)
* **Entrypoint:** Using `ENTRYPOINT` to execute the application properly and more robustly handling errors.
* **Error handling:** Implementing a more robust approach to check the application's exit status and logging any errors.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Build the original image using `docker build -f Dockerfile -t buggy-app .`
3. Run the buggy image using `docker run buggy-app` (Observe the insufficient error message).
4. Build the solution image using `docker build -f Dockerfile_solution -t fixed-app .`
5. Run the fixed image using `docker run fixed-app` (Observe proper log output).
